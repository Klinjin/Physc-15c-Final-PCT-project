## FABRICATION PROCESS: THE GERMANIUM DIODE
Early semiconductor developments used germanium
as the commercial semiconductor material however was
eventually replaced by silicon. However, germanium
diodes have the advantage of an intrinsically low forward
voltage drop, typically 0.3 volts; this low forward volt-
age drop results in a low power loss and more efficient
diode.[1] Hence, we used a germanium diode as the source
of semiconductor to build our device on.The diode looks
like Figure. 1.
